- Check out the theme functions that must be used: https://generatewp.com/wordpress-5-2-action-that-every-theme-should-use/

- Move header to template folder

- Header must scroll and then reappers as described in Figma

- Do we want some effect when clicking on buttons?

- Image in featured projects are featured images at the correct size. However, in this way I can only set one image size, and this will lead to a boring masonry. Can I use the wp sizes instead (full, thumbnail,...)

- outer-padding should be only horizontal. Uniform padding and margin between elements.

- Remove custom size post-title for images and set its size as thumbnail size
