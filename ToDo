- Move header to template folder

- Header must scroll and then reappers as described in Figma

- Transform all font sizes to relative?

- Set default font size (1rem) to 20px

- Do we want some effect when clicking on buttons?

- Use h1, p,... instead of text inside div with custom font size and weight

- Image in featured projects are featured images at the correct size. However, in this way I can only set one image size, and this will lead to a boring masonry. Can I use the wp sizes instead (full, thumbnail,...)

- Uniforme sizes (font ,margins,...) with bootstrap classes

- Clean unused css classes in home (mainly project section)

- Remove custom size post-title for images and set its size as thumbnail size
